# PyQt5App
My learning records of PyQt5 GUI programming  ＜/br＞
## At the start
PATH problem:  ＜/br＞
1...After installation of the PyQt5, the Path should be added into the Environment variable. Or just install the PyQt5 in Pycharm which is much easier.  ＜/br＞
2...Add Qt designer and PyUIC to the external tools in Pycharm  ＜/br＞
3...Use designer.exe to set up the main window. And I should save the file in the path of the pycharm project (instead of save to the package in the subpath of the pycharm project)  ＜/br＞
4...Use UIC to transfer the .ui file to the .py file .  ＜/br＞
5...And create a new .py file to control the reference in the mainwindow  ＜/br＞
6. WILL ADD MORE WHILE I'M LEARNING......  ＜/br＞
--------------------  ＜/br＞
# some tips may be useful to you...  ＜/br＞
if your program runned successfully, but show less letters on the mainwindow, don't worry, just add  ＜/br＞
```
label.resize(400,40)
```  
if your problems happen on label part, otherwise, change the 'label' to what you want.  ＜/br＞
